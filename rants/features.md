# Distinctive features

quoting Wkikipedia

|> In linguistics, a **distinctive feature** is the most basic unit of phonological structure that distinguishes one sound from another within a language. For example, the feature [+voice] distinguishes the two bilabial plosives: [p] and [b]. There are many different ways of defining and arranging features into feature systems: some deal with only one language while others are developed to apply to all languages. 

sure why not. in the ID, there are a bunch of these things and it would make sense to sortof unify them. Or so I thought.

there are of course the OGs like chomskys "sound pattern of english" and others . But when you really look into it, lot's of issues start to show up.
The fundametal problem is that distinctive features are first and foremost about contrast and therefore somewhat specific to a language. There seem to be more and more papers questioning whether a **universal model** is possible, than those trying to propose one. Which is unfortunate if you want to base a project like the ID on a model that fits all languages. And of course none of these papers end like so: https://xkcd.com/2268/ 

therefore a 
# change in course:

**all the classes will remain close to the source but transcribed into [+bla -blub]. The list of available natural classes will be extended to also cover all IPA groupings.**
```
Q => [+uvular ] and not [+consonantal +velar +back]

L = [+liquid] and not [+consonantal +approximant] Liquid
```
**All compound classes SHOULD be valid, but that won't be enforced through some feature geometry**

```
valid = [+vowel +front]
invalid = [+plosive +front]
```

## all classes

```
consonant
vowel
front
back
fricative
approximant
palatovelar
velar
liquid
nasal
sonorant
labial *
bilabial *
uvular
click
plosive
retroflex
voice
syllable
semivowel
continuant
affricate
laryngeal

* in the original ID P = Labial/Bilabial. Therefore all instances of P are [+labial,bilabial].
```

that way we can focuse on the data and leave the research on distinctive features and universality and contrast and how and if at all to the linguists. If we change our opinion in the future, switching would probably not be that hard.

# Index Diachronica Database Project
*The Index Diachronica as a database*

## What is it?

The Index Diachronica Database Project aims to convert the Index Diachronica, a collection of historical sound changes, into a text-based
database and mantain and solidify the dataset.

The Index Diachronica is a giant catalog of [sound changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_change) and is very large. It sections on   many languages and language families, as well as a fairly well-structured presentation of historical sound changes in those languages.
It is hosted here: [Index](https://chridd.nfshost.com/diachronica/) 

@amundo and @man-in-space had the idea to convert this document into a database of json files, because then the rules are data, and we can do all kinds of neat things with them. 

However there has been no activity on the project since 8 years. So I sneakily decided to fork the project and actually do it for real.

## Roadmap
- July: release v0.1.0 
- till September: decide on format 
- after that: start checking the rules, fix broken stuff and search new sound changes
 
## Notes
- sound changes and references will be converted into a standard format
- The Index Diachronica (usually) includes references. This means that the 
database could be checkable by experts in various fields.
- There are phonological inventories mixed into the soundchanges. Inventories are awesome, but they are a separate project. It would make sense to have a separate project, (perhaps we could call it the _Index Phonologica_!) to handle that. ()

## Logo and Mascot

I like the logo, however it maybe isn't fully representative of the project (one could think it's only about egyptian stuff), so we might change it. I want to keep the owl though, so I decided to make it the mascot.

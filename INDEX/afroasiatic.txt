6.2.2.1.7 Classical Arabic to Egyptian Arabic

Ed.; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic; At-Tonsi, Abbas, Heba Salem, and Nevenka Korica Sullivan (2013), Umm al-Dunya: Advanced Egyptian Colloquial Arabic; and from correspondence with my own Arabic professor, who is a native speaker of this dialect

θ ð → t d / “usually in numbers or cases where a short vowel has been deleted and it’s in contact with another stop, e.g. CA/MSA kaˈθiːr → EA ktiːr”

θ ð → s z

ðˤ → zˤ, occasionally tˤ

dˤ → zˤ (seems to be a sporadic change only affecting a few words, e.g. CA/MSA ˈdˤaːbitˤ → EA ˈzˤaːbitˤ)

dʒ → ɡ

i u → e o / only when short, ! _#

u → {o,u} / short only, _#

aj aw → eː oː / in U[+closed]

Vː → V / C_C{ː,C}V

V → Vː / C_CV in U[-stress]

V → Vː / _# + suffix

{i,u} → ∅ / VC_CV when unstressed (short only)

Some other short-vowel deletions

∅ → e / CVCC_CVCV (applies across word boundaries)

Resyllabification across word boundaries to prevent vowel-initial syllables
r gains emphatic status except when next to i, and even then it’s becoming more common in that environment

a(ː) → ɑ(ː) / near emphatics

a(ː) → ɑ(ː) / if ɑ(ː) is elsewhere in the word

a(ː) → æ(ː) / else (sometimes it seems more like ɛ(ː) to me)

q → ʔ / except in several words, two of which are al-Qâhira and musîqâ

Two consecutive consonants assimilate to the voicing of the second (obstruents only?)

{{s,z}(ˤ),ʒ}ʃ → ʃː

ʕ → {ʕ̞,ħ} / _h

Final short vowel loss

h → ∅ / in coda

θ ð ðˤ → t d dˤ

q → ɡ

aː → eː / in Form VI (tafā‘ala) verbs, though these apparently coexist with forms having the original vowel as well, with semantic distinctions

aː → æː / when not near emphatics

6.2.2.1.10 Classical Arabic to Hassāniyya Arabic

Pogostick Man, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hass%C4%81n%C4%ABya

NB: Words borrowed directly from CA/MSA seem to be immune to these changes. Also, unless otherwise noted, changes also apply to geminate consonants.

dˤ q → ðˤ ɡ

f θ → v z̪ (the article isn’t exactly clear on what this second phone is)

ʔ → {∅,j,w} / depending on the environment; again, the article is unclear

x → χ (conjectured based upon the following but not outright stated in the article)

ɣ → {ʁ,q}

V[-long] → ∅ / C_{C,#} (except for the feminine marker)

aj aw → eː(ʲ) oː(ʷ) (sometimes, the article is unclear)

The conditioning on these next two changes is conjectured based upon the source:

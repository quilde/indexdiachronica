37 Siouan-Iroquoian

Based upon Julian and Chafe, Proto-Siouan-Iroquoian, if it existed, appears to have had the following phonetic inventory:
	Bilabial 	Dental 	Alveolar 	Postalveolar 	Palatal 	Velar 	Glottal
Nasal 	m 		n
Plosive 	p pʰ 		t tʰ 			k kʰ 	ʔ
Fricative 		θ 	s 	ʃ 		x 	h
Liquid 			r 		j 	w
	Front 	Central 	Back
High 	i ı̃ 		u ũ
Mid 	e ẽ 		o õ
Low 		a ã

For this following section, the sound transcribed here as 〈r〉 may in actuality represent something akin to /ɹ/.

Siouan-Iroquoian, and for that matter the inclusion of Yuchian and Caddoan within the former and the latter, respectively, is far from universally accepted; their inclusion here is in large part due to the available sources giving correspondences for each. It was unknown whether Proto-Caddoan was the same as the Proto-Iroquois-Caddoan indicated in Cafe’s paper, so the Caddoan changes have been presented after the main Iroquoian changes.

Per KneeQuickie, Whimemsz wishes to “[n]ote that Siouan-Iroquoian is a proposed, rather than firmly-demonstrated, language grouping”.

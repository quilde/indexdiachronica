32 Oto-Manguean

Rensch (1977) reconstructs Proto-Oto-Manguean as having had the following phonemic inventory:
	Alveolar 	Palatal 	Velar 	Laryngeal
Nasal 	n
Plosive 	t 		k kʷ 	ʔ
Fricative 	s 			h
Liquid 		Y 	w
	Front 	Back
High 	i 	u
Low 	e 	a

Vowels could have had one of four tones, the first of which is denoted as a high tone.

32.2 Proto-Oto-Manguean to Tlapanec

Pogostick Man, from Rensch, Calvin R. (1977), “Classification of the Otomanguean Languages and the Position of Tlapanec”. Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics 55:53 – 108

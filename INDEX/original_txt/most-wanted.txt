47 Most-Wanted Sound Changes

This section replicates the “Most wanted sound changes” article from Knee Quickie. It is presented mostly as it was found with the following modifications:

    The formatting rules are not adhered to any longer due to the format, and the preamble (and table of contents) are omitted.
    Some liberty has been taken with the presentation of the *f → p change in Afro-Asiatic.
    Bullets are no longer present.
    Some corrections have been made (e.g., to the conditioning of the Ōkami change of *t → k).
    Instead of footnotes, sources (where cited) are listed next to the relevant entries.
    Some URLs have been shortened using http://is.gd due to potential conflict with the way LaTeX handles the 〈%〉 character.
    Subsection 4 is specifically listed as being “empty as of yet” for aesthetic purposes.
    Wikipedia URLs have been changed to https://. 

47.1 List 1: Simple Consonant Changes

w → p (Navajo, some Polynesian languages)

kʲ ɡʲ → k ɡ (Danish)

ś → k (Possibly unconditional; some Samoyedic langs)

pʲ → kʲ (some Romanian dialects, Tsakonian)

ts → t (unconditional; some Samoyedic langs)

t → k (general Polynesian)

n → ŋ (Samoan, but only in colloquial speech)

j → p (some Polynesian languages, such as Levei and Drehet) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Austronesian_language)

b → #c, -nc- (Sundanese)

ŋ → {x,h} (various Mayan languages)

h → ŋ (Nyole)

ʕ → ŋ (allegedly in European Hebrew, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, but possibly not a sound change so much as a substitution) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language#Varieties_of_ayin, http://sites.google.com/site/londonsephardiminhag/pronunciation, http://www.forward.com/articles/105938/)

f → p (? claimed to have occurred independently in Proto-Semitic and Proto-Omotic, and to a limited extent in Egyptian (but this may be related to the Semitic change); note that the Wikipedia article is cited to a single source and that source is admittedly theoretical, and acknowledges on page 77 another reconstruction that doesn’t believe Proto-Afro-Asiatic had /f/ at all) (Page 77 of http://is.gd/WNyXdn, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Afro-Asiatic_language)

tš → t (general Baltic-Finnic; may not be unconditional but was certainly the most common outcome)

r → ɡʟ → ɣ (Hiw) (http://is.gd/jCDLO1)

mb nd → ʙ dr (Nias)
47.2 List 2: Conditional or complex consonant changes

Western and Eastern Armenian often have swapped voicing in stop consonants: e.g. vardapet vs. vartabed. This is a result of changes related to aspiration.

w → f (Common Celtic; I’m not sure of the conditions)

m → n / _i (Tsakonian)

{t,k} → ∅ / V_V (Marathi) probably with voiced stops as intermediates, since they also became silent

p → w / V_V (Marathi)

b d ɡ → bː dː ɡː / V_V (some dialects of Italian; there may be more to it than this, since words like “repubblica” are in standard Italian and not just dialects)

t → k / _s̩ (Ōgami) (NB: The article doesn’t have an underscore indicating whether this occurs before or after the /s̩/, but the linked page indicates where this change occurred) (http://amritas.com/101023.htm#10192359)

n → i / _s and sometimes other fricatives (Montana Salish)
47.3 List 3: Vowels

y → u (some mainland Greek dialects, and Tsakonian; this particular sound change has been said in some places to be impossible) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsakonian_language#Consonants)

i u → s̩ f̩ (Ōgami) (http://amritas.com/101023.htm#10192359)

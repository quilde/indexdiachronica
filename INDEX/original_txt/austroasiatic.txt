Tonogenesis
Reg 	A 	B 	C 	d
1 	mid level 	low rising1 	high rising 	high rising
2 	low falling 	high-mid2 	high-mid2 	high-mid2

1. “Constricted” (laryngealized?)
2. Terminates in a glottal stop if no final stop

Presyllables don’t seem to have affected Muong much.

Initials:

s → h

cʰ → s

tʰ → h (Only seems to have occurred with first-register tones)

{kʰ,ɡʱ} → x (Presyllables don’t seem to have affected this much)

m n → b d (Only seems to have occurred with first-register tones)

{pj,bj} {tj,dj} {cj,ɟj} → b d j

ɓ ɗ → b d (Only seems to have occurred with first-register tones)

{n̥j,nj,ɲ̊j,ɲj} → ɲ j

N[-voiced] W[-voiced] → N[+voiced] W[+voiced]

(h)ə{p,b} → t / _l

m → ∅ / _l

tɹ → tʰ

Miscellanea:

w → ∅ / tʰV_k (conjectured)
9.1.2 Proto-Vietic to Middle Vietnamese

Pogostick Man, from Thompson, Laurence C. (1976), “Proto-Viet-Muong Phonology”. Oceanic Linguistics Special Publications 13, Austroasiatic Studies II:1113 – 1203; Wikipedia contributors (2012). “Hanoi”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hanoi&oldid=509052974>; Wikipedia contributors (2012), “Vietnamese Language”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Vietnamese_language&id=509331797>; Gage, William W. (1985), “Glottal Stops and Vietnamese Tonogenesis”. Oceanic Linguistics Special Publications 20:21 – 36; and Thompson, Laurence C. (1979?), “More on Viet-Muong Tonal Developments”

Initials:

bʱ {tʰ,dʱ} {t*ʰ,d*ʱ} {kʰ,ɡʱ} → pʰ t tʰ kʰ (after *kʰ *ɡʱ, only first-register tones may occur)

(h)ə{p,b} (h)ə{t,d} (h)ə{c,ɟ} (h)ə{k,ɡ} → β dʲ ɟ ɡ

{pj,bj} {tj,dj} {cj,ɟj} → {β,w} dʲ ɟ

ɓ ɗ → m n (For some reason it seems that only first-register tones can occur in this environment)

{n̥j,nj,ɲ̊j,ɲj} → ɲ (Thompson appears to me to have hedged a bit on the last one; based on other evidence in the paper I’m sticking this one as a palatal nasal)

tʃ → Ω (This is my own notation. I don’t have a clue what the intermediate form was; became something else in different dialects)

N[-voiced] W[-voiced] → N[+voiced] W[+voiced]

((h)ə)p d → b t / _l

t → ∅ / _ɹ (only first-register tones can occur in this environment)

t*ʰ d ɡ → tʰ t k / _w

s → t(ʰ?)

{əkʰ,əɡɦj} → ɟ (I think Thompson implied this was just a bit of a kludge)

Finals:

l → ∅ / {i,e}_

l → j / else

c ɲ → t n / ! E_ (apparently the precursor to Vietnamese short *a was treated as a short vowel here)

Thompson seems to list some changes as affecting Modern Vietnamese but I was unsure of where to put them so they’ll go here:

a ɔ → ɨə uə

In the original those first vowels were underlined.

{β,w} {dʲ,ɟ} → v z

ɹ → z (only seems to have occurred with first-register tones)

bl → z

ml → mɲ → ɲ (Thompson seems to indicate that this may have become [l] as well; only seems to have occurred with second-register tones)

Ω cʰ → s tɕ

Vowels:

ɨ → i / _(ə)w

ɛ → a / _C[+palatal]

Miscellanea:

w → ∅ / tV_wk (conjectured)
9.1.2.2 Middle Vietnamese to Saigon Vietnamese

1. Level when _S#; dipping otherwise
2. Laryngealized

Initials:

{β,w} → bj~vj~v

{bl,tl} → ʈ (?)

dʲ ɟ → z j

ɹ → ʐ (sometimes?)

Finals:

c ɲ t n → t n k ŋ / a_ (short /a/ only)

Vowels:

ə → ∅ / {i,ɨ}_{p,m.w}

ə → ∅ / ɨ_j

29.1.1.1 Athabaskan

Wikipedia gives the following reconstructions, adapted from Cook (1981), Krauss & Golla (1981), Krauss & Leer (1981), and Cook & Rice (1981) for the consonants and from Leer (2005:284) for the vowels; the vowel phonemes in parentheses are reduced.
	Bilabial 	Alveolar 	Postalveolar 	Velar 	Uvular 	Glottal
Nasal 	m 	n 	ɲ 			
Plosive 		t tʰ tʼ 		k kʰ kʼ 	q qʷ qʰ qʷʰ qʼ qʷʼ 	ʔ
Fricative 		s z 	ʃ ʃʷ ʒ ʒʷ 	x ɣ 	χ χʷ ʁ ʁʷ 	h
Lat. Fric. 		ɬ ɮ~l 				
Affricate 		t͜s t͜sʰ t͜sʼ 	t͜ʃ t͜ʃʷ t͜ʃʰ t͜ʃʷʰ t͜ʃʼ t͜ʃʷʼ 			
Lat. Aff. 		t͜ɬ t͜ɬʰ t͜ɬ’ 				
Approximant 			j 		w 	
	Front 	Back
High 	iː 	uː
Mid 	(ə) 	(ʊ)
Low 	eː 	(ɑ) ɑː

In addition, though it is not encountered in these changes, there is a phoneme that crops up in forms of the first-person singular pronoun which has various reflexes in many Athabaskan languages; Krauss (1976b) represents it as *$. Leer transcribed it as *šʸ in 2005:284 but in 2008 opted to use the *$ transcription.

The great majority of changes in this section are for the respective series of consonants, not for individual ones; therefore, changes specific to single consonants are marked so, and the reader should assume that unless explicitly stated, all of the following changes apply to the entire consonantal series. At the recommendation of Jan Strasser, the following conventions will be used to refer to the series; these are based on the abbreviations Whimemsz gave on the original Correspondence Library page, derived from the voiceless members of each series:

    T, dental stops
    TŁ, laterals
    TS, dental affricates and fricatives
    TŠ, palatals
    TŠʷ, labialized palatals
    K, front (palatalized) velars
    Q, uvulars
    Qʷ, labialized uvulars 

Whimemsz was unsure of the abbreviation of the glottal series. In addition, there also exist a series of (inter-?)dentals, abbreviated TH, and one of retroflexes, abbreviated TṢ. Changes marked with an asterisk, *, apply to the individual phone(me)s.

j w → ʒ v

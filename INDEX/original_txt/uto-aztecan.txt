43 Uto-Aztecan

The Wikipedia provides the following reconstruction for the phonology of Proto-Uto-Aztecan, which here is adapted with slight modifications as to the layout:
	Bilabial 	Coronal 	Palatal 	Velar 	Glottal
Nasal 	m 	n 		ŋ 	
Plosive 	p 	t 		k kʷ 	ʔ
Fricative 		s 			
Affricate 		ts 			
Rhotic 		r 			
Approximant 			j 	w 	
	Front 	Central 	Back
Close 	i 	ɨ 	u
Mid 			o
Open 		a 	

Quoth the Wiki, “*n and *ŋ may have actually been *l and *n, respectively.” It should be noted that there exists some discrepancy between this given reconstruction and in that set up for the studies deriving the reconstructions below. Radius Solis includes *h and *l as distinct phonemes as per the source he cited.

For the following Uto-Aztecan changes, Vu, Vs, and Vn refer to normal (“unaffecting”), “suspending”, and “nasalizing” vowels, respectively. According to Radius Solis, “Reconstructed PUA had three sets of vowels; this book calls them ‘suspending’, ‘unaltering’, and ‘nasalizing’. The nasalizing vowels likely were actually nasal, but it’s uncertain; their existence was deduced only by the sound changes that revolved around them. There’s few good guesses yet about the nature of the ‘suspending’ vowels, but their existence is likewise deducible from the sound changes that have been affected by them across a majority of the UA family - more changes than from the nasalizing series, occurring in all UA branches, enough to be pretty certain that it was a reality in PUA.”

43.6 Proto-Uto-Aztecan to Tohono O’odham

Radius Solis, from from Voegelin, Charles F., Florence M. Voegelin, & Kenneth L. Hale (1962), “Typological and Comparative Grammar of Uto-Aztecan: I (Phonology)”. International Journal of American Linguistics 28: Memoir 17

h → ʔ / #_

s ŋ → h n

n → ɲ / _V[+high]

l → ɲ / #_ “(in doubt; initial *l occurs in too few cognates to be sure. Apparently PUA initial *l was rare and is of questionable certainty whether it existed at all.)”

l → ɭ

ɭ → ɖ / _a

w → ɡ

j → dʒ / _V[+high]

j → d / _V[+low]

V → ∅ / “when in the first syllable of a bisyllabic morpheme, if after a morpheme boundary in the word (all other first-syllable vowels have non-zero reflexes)”

i → ∅ / ts_#

l → i / {p,m,k(ʷ),w}_# “in all dialects, and varies by dialect after other consonants”

“What happened to PUA */r/ in O’odham is difficult to say. There are only two known cognates, each showing a different reflex: /ɭ/ and /ɖ/”

A miscellaneous collection of vowel shifts.
46.1 7-to-5 Vowel Merger (Bantu)

Pogostick Man, from Schadeberg, Theo C. (1995), “Spirantization and the 7-to-5 Vowel Merger in Bantu”. In Sound Change, M. Dominicy and D. Demolin (Eds.), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1995.

S → F / _{i,u} (Do not necessarily have to be fricatives at the same POA; in some cases, the phones go to null or to /l/)

ɪ ʊ → i u
46.2 California Vowel Shift (English)

Pogostick Man, from Wikipedia contributors (2013), “California English”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=California_English&oldid=584388388>; and Eckert, Penelope, “Vowel Shifts in Northern California and the Detroit Suburbs”. <http://www.stanford.edu/~eckert/vowels.html>

æ ɪ → e i / _ŋ; some speakers (esp. in southern regions) may also have pin-pen and “a single phoneme in contrast to the nasal diphthong [ãɪ̃] of the U.S. Northeast” (though the article doesn’t specify what this is; maybe it’s just plain ã)

/ɪ/ otherwise has a highly variable pronunciation

æ → {eə̯,ɪə̯} / _N

{æ,e} → ɛ / _ɹ

æ → a

ʊ ʌ ɛ → ʌ ɛ æ

ɑ → ɔ (does not occur in Sacramento)

u → {iʊ̯,ʉ,ɯ}

oʊ̯ → eʊ̯ (“common only within certain social groups”)

46.5 Old English-to-Scots Vowel Shifts

Pogostick Man, from Wikipedia contributors (2014), “Phonological history of Scots”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phonological_history_of_Scots&oldid=582962563>; and Wikipedia contributors (2014), “Scottish Vowel Length Rule”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scottish_vowel_length_rule&oldid=589349104>

ai → ɛi → əi / when stem-final

uː → ʌu / when-stem final, in northern varieties

øː → wi / {k,ɡ}_ (in Mid Northern dialects)

øː → i (in northern dialects)

øː → (j){u,ʌ} / _{k,x} (outcome varies depending upon dialect)

a → i / _n (in northern varieties)

a → e / _n (otherwise)

a → {ɛ,e} / _rC

ai oi ui ei au ou iu ɛ(o)u → eː oe əi iː {ɑː,ɔː} ʌu ju j(ʌ)u

ɛː → ɛi (→ əi?) / in some northern varieties

iː eː ɛː aː oː uː {øː,yː} → əi i {i,e} e o u ø

æ → ɛ / _C[+alveolar]

a ɔ u → {a,ɑ} ɔ ʌ

Application of the Scottish vowel-length rule:

— V → Vː / _{r,F[+voiced],$,#}

— əi → aɪ / _{r,F[+voiced],$,#} (pursuant to the above)
46.6 Great Ngamo Tone Shift

Pogostick Man, from Schuh, Russel (2005), “The Great Ngamo Tone Shift”

In the Gudi dialect, the tone on a given domain (which can be more than one syllable/mora, as long as said syllables/morae are consecutive and share the same tone) shift to the following domain, with a low tone cropping up on the first domain. The original tone of the word-final domain floats or tacks itself onto the next domain, depending upon the surrounding conditions. When utterance-final, these tones remain on that domain. This can cause a falling tone, but not a rising tone, which Ngamo does not permit; where such would occur, tone goes to high.
46.7 Great Vowel Shift (English)

Jaaaaaa and Ran, citing http://www.peak.org/~jeremy/dictionary/chapters/history.php

iː uː → əj əw → ɑj ɑw

eː oː → iː uː

ɛː → eː → iː

aː ɔː → ɛː oː → eː ow → ej (əw)

y(ː) ɔː → i(ː) ɔ

ɛu au → ɛv av
46.9 Kikuyu Tone Shift

Pogostick Man, from Schuh, Russel (2007), “The Great Ngamo Tone Shift (GNTS)”

Tones move to the following vowel with the initial syllable acquiring a low tone. Original final tones are lost.
46.10 Late Proto-Finnic to Savonian Vowel Shift

PM_Vanhanen

“Long close-mid vowels have become diphthongs:”

eː øː oː → ie yø uo

“In some dialects, they have shifted further to /uɑ/, /yæ/ and /iæ/ or /iɑ/ depending on front-back vowel harmony: /tieto/ to /tiɑto/ but /tietæ/ to /tiætæ/.”

“These shifts have occurred in some eastern dialects.”

ɑː æː ɑi æi → uɑ iæ ɑe æe

ei oi øi → eː oe øe

ɑu ou → ɑː oː

æy øy → æː øː

eu → eo

li ni ri si → lʲi nʲi rʲi sʲi
46.11 Middle Chinese to Cantonese Vowel Shift (“The Inner-Outer Flip”)

LoneWolf, from Newman, J. (1983). Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orentale XII.1:65 – 79.

Relevant changes occurring before the shift:

a → ɔ / _{ŋ,k}

uə yə → ɔ œ / _{n,t}

ə → ∅ / i_{ŋ,k}

∅ → ə / C[+ labiovelar]_i

∅ → ə / _u

V → Vː / _#

The actual vowel shift:

ə → a

a → {aː,ə} “(the environments for these respective changes are somewhat unclear)”

ə → a / _{i,u}

iəu → au

a → aː / _{i,u}

a → ə → ∅ / i_u

Other relevant changes occurring at the same time:

ə → ∅ / W_

W → ∅ / C_

(Apparently, /i u/ either were or became glides in the appropriate positions)
46.12 Northern Cities Vowel Shift (English)

Pogostick Man, from Wikipedia contributors (2013), “Northern Cities Vowel Shift”. Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia. <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northern_Cities_Vowel_Shift&oldid=581062574>

æ raises and diphthongizes, typically becoming one of {ɛə eə ɪə}

ɑ ɔ → a ɑ

ɛ → ɐ

ʌ → ɔ

ɪ → ɪ̞

u i e a → y e a o
46.18 South African Chain Shift (English)

Pogostick Man, from Mesthrie, Rajend (2002), Language in South Africa

NB: The author gives ı̆ as the shifted vowel but calls it “centralized”; based on this description, I’m calling it /ɨ/.

æ ɛ ɪ → ɛ e ɨ
46.19 Southern [United States] Shift (English)

Pogostick Man, from Wikipedia contributors (2012), “Southern American English”.

ɛ → ɪ / _N

“Lax and tense vowels often neutralize before /l/”

aɪ → aː / _#

aɪ → aː / _C[+ voiced]

aɪ → ɑeː / else (only for some speakers)

aɪ → aː / else (only for some speakers)

æ ɛ ɪ → æj(ə) ɛj(ə) ɪj(ə)

ɛj(ə) ɪj(ə) i eɪ → ej(ə) ij(ə) ɪi ɛi

uʊ oʊ → ʉʊ̈ əʊ̈ (a bit of a guesstimate based upon the prose description in the article and the mean-formant-value chart cited from Labov, Ash & Bobert (2006))

ɔ → ɑɒ (for some speakers)

ɑɹ → ɒɹ (“often”)

z → d / _n (not strictly a vowel shift but included here anyway because it’s cool, and also because it doesn’t occur in 〈hasn’t〉 because of the influence of 〈hadn’t〉)

Stress reassignment to the initial syllable (again, not strictly a vowel shift)
Merger of ɔɹ and ɑɹ (“in some regions”)
Loss of distinction between ɪɹ and ɪəɹ, and between ʊəɹ and ɔɹ
Pronunciation of the 〈l〉 in words like 〈walk〉 and 〈talk〉 (again, not really a vowel development)

æ/ɑː → æɪ
